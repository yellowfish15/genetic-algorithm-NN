Neural Network that evolves to learn Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a basic implementation of a neural network model
that evolves through natural selection

Run the MainAuto.java file in src/ to train the model
Run the MainPlay.java file in src/ to play against the trained NN

The weights and biases of the trained model are saved in the "nn.ylnn" file
