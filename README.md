# genetic-algorithm-NN

## Description
Neural Network that evolves to learn Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a basic implementation of a neural network model that evolves through natural selection

The `Model.java` and `Matrix.java` files contain the neural network model and matrix operations respectively

## Instructions

Run the `MainAuto.java` file in src/ to train the model

Run the `MainPlay.java` file in src/ to play against the trained NN

## Save File
The weights and biases of the trained model are saved in the "nn.ylnn" file
